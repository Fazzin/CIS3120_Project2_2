          The project aims to determine if the average swimmer is taller than the average volleyball player.
          It does this by scraping the data of athletes' names and heights from two different sports, volleyball, and swimming & diving.
          It pulls from 9 different universities for volleyball and 10 different universities for swimming & diving. 
          It also finds the names and heights of the athletes with the 5 tallest and shortest heights for both men's and women's teams.
          The program uses the data to create a dataframe and a bar graph showing the average height distribution across the 4 different
          team categories (men's swimming, men's volleyball, women's swimming, women's volleyball). Finally, it exports the data as a CSV.
